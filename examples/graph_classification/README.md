# Graph Classification

* [Graph classification on TU (graph backend)](graph_classification_TU.py): Graph classification on the TU dataset graphs using the NetworkX as the DeepSNAP graph manipulation backend.
* [Graph classification on TU (tensor backend)](graph_classification_TU_tensor.py): Graph classification on the TU dataset graphs only using tensors as the DeepSNAP graph manipulation backend.
* [Graph classification on TU (transformation)](graph_classification_TU_transform.py): Graph classification on the TU dataset graphs with transformations.

## Training

Run the following command as an example.

```sh
python graph_classification_TU_tensor.py
```
